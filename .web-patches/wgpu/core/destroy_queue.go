// TrackedSubmission holds Clone'd ResourceRefs associated with a GPU submission.
// When the GPU completes this submission (index <= completedIndex), all refs
// are Drop()'d, decrementing their reference counts and potentially triggering
// destruction when no other owners remain.
//
// This is the Phase 2 per-command-buffer tracking mechanism: resources are
// Clone'd when used during encoding, transferred here on Submit, and Drop'd
// when the GPU finishes.

// DestroyQueue tracks in-flight GPU submissions and defers resource destruction

//
// Matches Rust wgpu-core's LifetimeTracker pattern where resource Drop only
// fires after triage_submissions confirms the fence has passed.
//
// Usage:
//  1. On resource Release(): call Defer(lastSubmissionIndex, destroyFn)
//  2. On Queue.Submit(): call Triage(PollCompleted()) to destroy completed resources
//  3. On Device.Release(): call FlushAll() to destroy everything
//
// Phase 2 adds TrackSubmission() for per-command-buffer resource tracking:
//
//	On Queue.Submit(): call TrackSubmission(subIdx, refs) with Clone'd refs
//	On Triage(): completed submissions' refs are Drop()'d
//
// Thread-safe for concurrent use.
